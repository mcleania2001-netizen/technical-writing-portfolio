# ## About this portfolio

#I am a senior technical writer with over 25 years of experience producing clear, accurate documentation for complex technical platforms and services in large, regulated environments.

#My work has focused on cloud and platform technologies, including container-based platforms and hybrid environments, with responsibility for end-to-end documentation delivery. In recent roles, I acted as the sole technical #writer supporting multiple services in a customer-facing context, covering authoring, review, publication, governance, and ongoing maintenance.

#I have experience creating a wide range of documentation types, including user guides, onboarding material, service and platform documentation, SOPs, process documentation, and operational guidance. I also design and #maintain documentation spaces, including structure, standards, and access control.

#This portfolio contains selected, sanitised examples of written and visual documentation, including guides, diagrams, and video explainers. All samples are representative and created for demonstration purposes.
